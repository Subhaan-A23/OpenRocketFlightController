# OpenRocketFlightController

An open source rocket flight controller. It is designed to activate some functionality when a specific altitude is reached. For this current repository, the functionality activiated will be to electrically fire an E-Match. However, this can be programmed for any desirable functionality.

The flight controller will use a barometric pressure sensor, and an accelerometer. Currently this is in development phase and so the sensors used will be cheaper available components. However, after development, a more suitable pressure sensor that can measure upto higher altitudes and an accelerometer that can measure upto 200G of acceleration will be used for real use.

Feel free to use and modify this code as desired. However, if you use this software, please cite this as:
